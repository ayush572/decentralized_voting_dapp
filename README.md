# decentralized_voting_dapp
* This application was supposed to be using the blockchain feature in order to help the voters vote from their home and even their vote cannot be tampered with due to the blockchain feature of immutablility

### Problem
* I am unable to connect to the client side even though I am using web3.js. No error in the console but neither it is being connected to the local ganache blockchain even though I have added the local ganache network to the metamask and associated one of the ganache accounts with it.
* After the problem will get resolved or maybe I will work on another porject and come back on this later
